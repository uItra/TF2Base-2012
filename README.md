# TF2Base (2012)
Released on Game-Deception in 2k12.
This was created back then to make people strive away from Valve's SDK unless they want to have a bloated file size.
I don't recommend using/working further on this base since its old and should just be here as a memory.

Disclaimers: Sorry for making your eyes bleed.
